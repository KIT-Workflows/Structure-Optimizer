# Structure-Optimizer

In this workflow, we use the SimStack framework features to generate conformers of Organic Molecules by combining the metadynamics, genetic algorithm, density functional tight binding, and DFT methods. Here, we use six different WaNos: DFTBplus, Conformer-gen, Mult-It, DFT-Turbomole, and Table-Generator. These WaNos are used to load the file structure, generate conformers, and perform optimization by combining DFTB+ and DFT codes. A table containing the system's HOMO, LUMO energies, and molecule labels is the expected output of the workflow.
